It's no good, I can't maneuver! At least with this watchface, you'll be able to tell the time. Featuring the Star Wars Targeting Computer, this watchface includes the time, date, step count (at the bottom), and battery percentage (at the top).

May the Force be with you.

You can find it on the App Store [here](https://goo.gl/ataS3J), and as always, if you like it, give it a heart.
